# Roadmap (MVP → Phases)

## MVP (6–10 weeks, Codex-first)
Goal: deliver a usable, senior-friendly web app that proves the Links/Story/Self loop.

- Story: create/edit life profile & memorial page, upload media (basic)
- Links: family invitations + simple family tree
- Permissions: private / family / friends / public (+ per-content override)
- Self: life-log minimal + guided reflection prompts (form-based)
- Basic admin: reports / content moderation hooks (minimal)

## Phase 2
- Future letters (scheduled/conditional publishing)
- Virtual offerings (flowers/incense) + visit logs
- QR bridge (generate QR, manage scans)
- Billing (premium tier)
- Online ceremony beta (temple scheduling + video link)

## Phase 3
- Advanced community discovery
- AI features (timeline extraction, story summaries, reflection questions)
- Long-term preservation layer
- Optional DNA/physical proof program (compliance-first)
