# LifeLink — Your links. Your story. Your self.

**LifeLink** is a platform that helps people **connect lives (Links)**, preserve and curate **life stories (Story)**, and support **self-rediscovery (Self)** through reflection and relationships—starting in life, continuing beyond.

## Product pillars
- **Links**: family lineage (vertical), communities (horizontal), real-world bridges (QR/temple/ceremony).
- **Story**: memorial profiles, media, timeline, life log, message capsules.
- **Self**: reflection flows, life review prompts, meaning-making, optional AI assistance.

## Docs
- `docs/00_concept/lifelink_concept.md` — brand + concept map (Links/Story/Self)
- `docs/10_requirements/requirements_core.md` — requirements distilled from the uploaded Nexia PDF
- `docs/20_spec/lifelink_spec.md` — technical & functional spec (ported from Eternal Link spec)
- `docs/30_roadmap/roadmap.md` — MVP → Phase plan

## Codex workflow (recommended)
1. Start Codex in the repo root.
2. Run `/plan` first for any multi-step change.
3. Keep changes minimal; update docs first, then code.
